# Portfolio Proof Additions (Resume Fact Bank Addendum)

Use these bullets to make resume generation proof-first for the target titles.

## Global proof (use across roles)
- Published a live GitHub Pages portfolio linking directly to code, CI runs, artifacts, and evidence outputs.
- Implemented CI/CD in both GitHub Actions and Jenkins (pipeline-as-code) for a .NET build pipeline; builds run on a Windows agent with archived artifacts.
- Built a Windows baseline audit tool in PowerShell that generates a shareable HTML report; included a downloadable sample report in the portfolio.

## Role-targeted bullets

### 1) Modern Workplace / M365 Endpoint Architect
- Evidence-first endpoint posture: baseline snapshots + report artifacts to validate configuration and support audit readiness.
- Policy-driven rollout mindset: standardization, repeatability, and safe change validation.

### 2) Endpoint Management Engineer (Intune / Jamf)
- Endpoint automation mindset: consistent onboarding patterns, validation outputs, and troubleshooting-friendly evidence capture.

### 3) Systems Administrator / Endpoint Engineer
- Practical Windows configuration baselining and validation workflow; outputs can be used for troubleshooting and change verification.

### 4) Cloud Engineer (Azure / M365)
- Cloud operations with automation-first approach; repeatable scripts and validation artifacts reduce drift and manual work.

### 5) Azure Migration / Infrastructure Engineer
- Migration posture: structured validation and evidence artifacts help verify cutovers and reduce risk.

### 6) Solutions Architect / Systems Engineer
- Proof-first architecture communication: clear artifacts, reproducible workflows, and traceable outputs.

### 7) Build & Release / Deployment Automation Engineer
- Pipeline-as-code: Jenkinsfile + GitHub Actions workflow; deterministic build steps; artifact archival.

### 8) IT Support Specialist (Tier 2/3)
- Evidence capture and reporting: baseline outputs speed triage and make troubleshooting repeatable.

### 9) Platform / Automation Engineer (Scripting & Tooling)
- Tooling mindset: scripts designed to be reusable, safe, and extendable into operational workflows.
